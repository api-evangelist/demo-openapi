# Manage OpenAPI via GitHub Demo
This is  repository to demo how GitHub can be used to manage an OpenAPI, using an APIs.json index and folder structure. 

The APIs.json index provide the business contract for the API, and OpenAPI provides the technical contract, with other artifacts augmenting the contracts. 

This is just a demo repository to support a blog post, you can follow the actual [APIs.io Search API](https://github.com/api-search/search-api) repository, or read [the blog post to better understand how it works](https://github.com/api-evangelist/demo-openapi).
